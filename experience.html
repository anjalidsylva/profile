  <h1>Experience</h1>

  <p>
    I bring over 15 years of experience supporting senior leadership across
    private equity, aviation, global consumer brands, and high-growth
    organisations operating across the UK, US, and India.
  </p>

  <h3>Chief of Staff & Executive Operations</h3>
  <p>
    I have operated as a trusted right hand to founders, CEOs, and C-suite
    executives, supporting strategic planning, executive decision-making,
    operational execution, and stakeholder coordination in complex and
    fast-moving environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work typically sits at the intersection of leadership priorities,
    cross-functional execution, and organisational clarity — ensuring decisions
    translate into action with consistency, discretion, and pace.
  </p>

  <h3>Enterprise & Institutional Exposure</h3>
  <p>
    My foundation was shaped within institutional and enterprise-grade
    environments, including KKR, Estée Lauder Companies, and international
    aviation organisations, where precision, confidentiality, and sound
    judgment were non-negotiable.
  </p>

  <h3>Operational Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    Across roles, I have led initiatives spanning operations, CRM, governance,
    communications, and executive enablement — designing workflows, dashboards,
    and reporting structures that improved visibility, alignment, and
    follow-through at leadership level.
  </p>

  <h3>Current Focus</h3>
  <p>
    Today, I work in fractional and remote capacities with US- and UK-based
    leaders, supporting scale, transition, and execution through Chief of
    Staff–led engagements.
