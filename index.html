    <h1>Anjali D'Sylva</h1>
<h2>Fractional Chief of Staff & Executive Operations Partner</h2>

<p>
I support founders and leadership teams across the US & UK with executive
support, business operations, and strategic execution.
</p>

<p>
With over a decade of experience across global organisations, I’ve supported
senior leaders and C-suite executives in fast-moving, high-stakes environments,
bringing structure, clarity, and calm to complex operations.
</p>

<p>
My background includes working with enterprise and institutional-grade
organisations such as KKR, Estée Lauder, and global aviation and consumer
brands, as well as high-growth companies operating across markets.
</p>

<h3>How I Work</h3>
<p>
I operate as a trusted extension of leadership — bridging vision and execution,
shaping business rhythm, and ensuring priorities translate into action.
My work spans executive support, operations, stakeholder coordination,
and strategic projects, delivered through fractional, retainer, or scoped
engagements.
